This repository demonstrates a common Objective-C memory management bug involving the incorrect use of the 'assign' property attribute.  The `DanglingPointerBug.m` file shows the problematic code, where an object is assigned to a property using 'assign', and subsequently deallocated.  The `DanglingPointerSolution.m` file provides a corrected version using 'strong' or 'retain' to manage memory properly.  This example illustrates the importance of careful attention to memory management in Objective-C to prevent dangling pointer exceptions.
