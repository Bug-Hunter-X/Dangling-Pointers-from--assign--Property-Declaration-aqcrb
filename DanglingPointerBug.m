In Objective-C, a common yet subtle issue arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with properties declared using `assign` instead of `retain` or `strong` for objects.  If a property is declared using `assign`, the setter simply copies the pointer value. When the original object is deallocated, the pointer in your property becomes a dangling pointer, leading to crashes or unexpected behavior upon access. This is particularly insidious because it might not always manifest immediately.
