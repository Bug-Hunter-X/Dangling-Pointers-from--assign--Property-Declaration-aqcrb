To correct this, change the property declaration to use `strong` (for ARC) or `retain` (for non-ARC).  This ensures the object's retain count is incremented when assigned and decremented appropriately upon release, preventing dangling pointers.  For example:

// Incorrect (using assign)
@property (nonatomic, assign) MyObject *myObject;

// Correct (using strong - recommended for ARC)
@property (nonatomic, strong) MyObject *myObject;
